Hello! Iâ€™m Yoav, a graduate student specializing in machine learning with a focus on interpretability and AI systems, currently in [Mor Geva's](https://mega002.github.io/) lab. My passion lies in unraveling complex models to understand their inner workings and developing meaningful applications. Outside of research, I enjoy playing music, slacklining, climbing and spikeball :).
