Hello! Iâ€™m Yoav, a graduate student at Mor Gevaâ€™s lab, where I specialize in interpretability research in LLMs. My work focuses on understanding how large language models operate internally, particularly how they store and retrieve knowledge. I also explore methods to refine these systems to make them safer and more effective for diverse applications.

Beyond my research, Iâ€™m part of the Adi Lautman Interdisciplinary Program for Outstanding Students at Tel Aviv University. This unique program fosters creativity and independent thinking, allowing students to explore any academic field. Iâ€™ve taken advantage of this freedom to study biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and history, gaining insights that complement my technical work.

Outside of my work, I enjoy slacklining, climbing, playing Spikeball, and playing music ðŸ™ƒ.
