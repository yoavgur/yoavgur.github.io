That is, they can enable us to study and use a more granular and hopefully monosemantic unit in an LLM.</p> <p>This has made them a particularly intriguing method for influencing LLMs in targeted ways, such as steering. Motivated by this, we explored their potential for <strong>knowledge erasure</strong>, aiming to determine whether they could support the selective removal of targeted information while maintaining the overall utility of a model.</p> <h4 id="knowledge-erasure">Knowledge Erasure</h4> <p>For simplicity, we use the simplistic setting of fact triplets ($s$, $r$, $o$) where $s$ is the subject, $r$ is the relation, and $o$ is the object. In this setting, our goal would be to affect our language model’s ability to generate tokens related to $o$ when prompted with $s$ and $r$. For example, when prompted with the sentence “<em>Barack Obama</em> (subject) <em>was born in</em> (relation)”, we want to make it so the language model in question won’t answer <em>Hawaii</em> (object).</p> <p>To do this, we’d hope to find an SAE feature that activates when prompted with the subject and relation, and which then promotes the token corresponding to the object. The challenge now is finding such a feature. We’ll use Gemma-2-2B as our target model for these experiments.</p> <h4 id="how-to-find-sae-knowledge-features">How to Find SAE Knowledge Features</h4> <p>To find the features of interest, we first need to know where to look. The way LLMs answer knowledge related queries in our setting is detailed in the paper <em>Dissecting Recall of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Language Models</em><d-cite key="geva-etal-2023-dissecting"></d-cite>. There, they show that the models follow three general steps:</p> <ol> <li>Subject enrichment, where the hidden representation of the final token of the subject is enriched by MLP layers with information relating to it. For the subject <em>Barack Obama</em>, the token <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Obama</code> would be enriched with information like his birth date, where he went to college, and of course, where he was born.</li> <li>The relation information is propagated from the relation tokens to the final token.</li> <li>The relation information in the final token is used to extract the relevant information from the last subject token to the final token - i.e. in our example the token <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hawaii</code> would be extracted from the hidden representation in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Obama</code> token position, and moved to the final token position.</li> </ol> <p>That means that a good way to erase the knowledge we want to erase, is to find which MLP SAE features are responsible for enriching the subject token with the information we want to erase.</p> <p>So now we know where to look - MLP SAE features that activate on the last token position of the subject token. But how do we know which one of these features?</p> <p>We could use existing feature descriptions, available for Gemma on Neuronpedia, to isolate ones that look like they relate. But as we showed in our paper<d-cite key="gurarieh2025enhancingautomatedinterpretabilityoutputcentric"></d-cite>, the methods used for generating these descriptions are mostly related to what activates a feature and not what it does once activated. Therefore, for each feature we can use vocabulary projection on the feature’s SAE decode column, and look to see if there are relevant tokens there - i.e. ones related to the object in our fact. Indeed, when looking at all MLP SAE features that activate for the token <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Obama</code>, we see that feature 4999 in layer 6 seems to encode for the concept of the USA, and that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hawaii</code> appears in the top 100 tokens of its vocabulary projection. This seems to be the feature we’re looking for!</p> <h4 id="erasing-the-knowledge---ablating-the-feature">Erasing the Knowledge - Ablating the Feature</h4> <p>Now that we have a method for finding the relevant features, we just have to prevent the feature from firing, or, ablating it. Practically, this means overriding its value so it’ll always be zero, but it’s been found that this doesn’t always work well enough<d-cite key="farrell2024applying"></d-cite>, and so instead we’ll try to set it to negative values.</p> <p>Now if we ablate the feature we found earlier that encodes for the concept of the USA, and prompt the model to answer where Barack Obama was born, funnily enough it answers <strong>Kenya</strong>! Looks like we might have accidentally made our model a birther…</p> <p>And these results seem to replicate across many facts!</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Prompt</th> <th>Original Generation</th> <th>Ablated Feature</th> <th>New Generation</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Barack Obama was born in</td> <td> <strong>Hawaii</strong>, but he was raised in Indonesia.

We showed that this can enable us to perform targeted erasures, removing the undesirable knowledge and leaving the model still capable. For example, when we ablated the UK feature for Winston Churchill, the model continued the prompt saying that he was the prime minister of the US. But, it also added that it was during the Second World War (correct period) and that he was the first person to be elected to that office! Meaning while we edited the fact such that UK -&gt; US, the model still has its context about the US governing structure.</p> <p>While these results showcase intriguing potential, they remain a proof-of-concept. Establishing whether SAEs can truly serve as a reliable method for knowledge erasure—or for broader knowledge editing—requires rigorous evaluation. Future work should systematically test their precision in editing knowledge without unintended side effects on model performance.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/2025-01-17-sae-knowledge-erasure.bib"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Yoav Gur-Arieh. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-table@1.22.4/dist/bootstrap-table.min.js" integrity="sha256-4rppopQE9POKfukn2kEvhJ9Um25Cf6+IDVkARD0xh78=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?70d799092f862ad98c7876aa47712e20"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
